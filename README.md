# Project Wizard

A standalone, multi-project **planning + scaffolding** app. Each project walks a
human through the decisions only a human can make — product, requirements,
locked decisions, milestones, risks, non-functional/scale — then **generates the
project's full `/docs` structure** (pages, governance library, markdown corpus,
GitHub gate) plus a `PLAN-INTAKE.json` and an `AI-HANDOFF.md` for a coding agent
to build from. From the same screen you can **download it** or **deploy it as a
container** to a Docker host over SSH.

- **Home** — a tile per project + a **New project** button (also the empty state).
- **Draft tile → wizard.** A multi-step intake that autosaves server-side.
- **Generated tile → the doc structure**, browsable, with an **Export** menu:
  server bundle `.zip` · standalone static HTML · **Deploy to Docker** (over SSH).

It runs as one container. Stand it up once on a host (e.g. per client), and users
create projects in the browser and deploy them onto that same host.

## Stand it up on a host with Claude Code (over SSH)

This is the one-shot setup. Point a Claude Code session at this repo, give it a
target host, and it does the rest — ending with the wizard live at
`http://wizard.<HOST_IP>.nip.io/` and a working **New project** button.

**You provide:** this repo's URL, and the Docker host's **IP**, **SSH user**, and
**SSH password** (or a key). The host is any reachable **Ubuntu** box on your LAN
— a fresh VM is fine; Docker need not be installed yet.

### Recommended: Claude Code running *on* the Ubuntu box

The cleanest setup (and the one these instructions assume) is to run **Claude Code
on the Ubuntu host itself**, driven by **Claude Desktop** on your Windows PC over a
remote connection. Because the agent lives on the host, the work **keeps running
even after you shut the Windows PC down** — and there's no SSH hop to babysit.

Install Claude Code on the box once (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`,
or see the docs), connect Claude Desktop to it, then paste the prompt below.

**Paste this into the Claude Code session on the host** (fill in the blanks):

```text
Set up the Project Wizard on this Docker host, end to end. You are running ON the
target Ubuntu box, so run everything locally — no SSH.

Repo: https://github.com/SteamGauge-Consulting/project-wizard
GitHub token: <GH_TOKEN>        (classic PAT, `repo` scope — to clone the private repo)
Host IP: <HOST_IP>              (optional — omit to use this box's primary LAN IP)

Run this single command (it installs git, clones the repo with the token, strips
the token back out of git config, then runs the setup):

   sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y -qq git \
   && rm -rf ~/apps/project-wizard \
   && git clone https://<GH_TOKEN>@github.com/SteamGauge-Consulting/project-wizard.git ~/apps/project-wizard \
   && git -C ~/apps/project-wizard remote set-url origin https://github.com/SteamGauge-Consulting/project-wizard.git \
   && bash ~/apps/project-wizard/scripts/setup-host.sh <HOST_IP>

setup-host.sh installs Docker (+ log rotation), creates the `web` network, brings
up a Traefik reverse proxy AND Portainer, then builds + starts the wizard behind
the proxy. When it finishes, verify http://wizard.<HOST_IP>.nip.io/ returns 200
and give me that URL.
```

### Alternative: drive it over SSH from your own machine

If you'd rather run Claude Code on your laptop and reach the host over SSH (works
from macOS, Linux, or Windows — Windows has `ssh` built in), use this prompt
instead. Everything still executes ON the host inside one SSH session:

```text
Set up the Project Wizard on my Docker host, end to end.

Repo: https://github.com/SteamGauge-Consulting/project-wizard
GitHub token: <GH_TOKEN>        (classic PAT, `repo` scope — to clone the private repo)
Host IP: <HOST_IP>
SSH user: <USER>
SSH auth: <key at <PATH>  OR  password: <PASSWORD>>

1. SSH to the host. If a key path was given use `ssh -i <PATH> <USER>@<HOST_IP>`;
   if a password was given, authenticate with it (accept the host key on first
   connect). On Windows with password auth, run the ssh command interactively.
2. On the host, run the same single command shown above (apt-get install git →
   git clone with the token → strip the token → bash setup-host.sh <HOST_IP>).
3. Verify http://wizard.<HOST_IP>.nip.io/ returns 200, then give me that URL.
```

**What the host ends up running:** Docker + a Traefik reverse proxy + Portainer +
this wizard, all reachable by hostname via [nip.io] (no DNS setup). The wizard
lands at `wizard.<HOST_IP>.nip.io`; Portainer at `portainer.<HOST_IP>.nip.io`; the
Traefik dashboard at `<HOST_IP>:8080`; and every project a user later deploys from
the wizard lands at `<name>.<HOST_IP>.nip.io` on the same box. The wizard homepage
also carries **Containers** (Portainer) and **Proxy** (Traefik) buttons.

> **Repo access — it stays private; pick one:**
> 1. **No key** — Claude clones with the GitHub access already in your session,
>    then rsyncs to the host (the host needs no GitHub access). Simplest.
> 2. **A token** — give Claude a **classic PAT** (`repo` scope; read is enough)
>    and it clones over HTTPS: `git clone https://<TOKEN>@github.com/…`. Use this
>    when you want the *host itself* to clone or `git pull` updates later.
>    ⚠️ This org has **deploy keys and fine-grained tokens disabled**, so a
>    *classic* PAT is the kind that works — make one at
>    github.com/settings/tokens. (Personal account, not org settings.)
> 3. **Make it public** — then no key at all.
>
> Whichever you use, the repo never needs to be public. To rotate, revoke the
> classic PAT and issue a new one — nothing on the host is hard-wired to it
> unless you chose option 2's `git clone` (then update the stored credential).

**Prefer to run it yourself?** SSH to the host, get the repo there (`git clone` or
copy), then:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-host.sh        # uses the box's primary IP; or pass one explicitly
```

---

## How users use it

1. Open `http://wizard.<HOST_IP>.nip.io/` → **New project**, then pick how to start:
   - **Start from scratch** — answer the wizard.
   - **Use an existing app** — upload its code (files, a folder, or a `.zip`) and
     the wizard reverse-engineers a draft plan you review instead of writing from
     scratch. See [Reverse-engineer from code](#reverse-engineer-from-code-use-an-existing-app-to-start).
2. Walk the steps (Product · Integrations · Reference · Requirements · Decisions ·
   Milestones · Risks · Non-Functional & Scale), then **Generate**.
3. On the project's doc view, hit **Export**:
   - **Download — server bundle** (run with `npm start`),
   - **Download — standalone HTML** (flat pages, relative links, opens from a
     Downloads folder with no server), or
   - **Deploy to Docker** — enter the host IP, SSH user + **password**, an app
     name, and an optional `<name>.<HOST_IP>.nip.io` hostname, then **Deploy now**.
     The wizard rsyncs the package to the host and runs `docker compose up -d
     --build`, showing the live URL + build log.

Watch containers come up from the homepage buttons — **Containers** (Portainer,
a full container GUI) and **Proxy** (the Traefik dashboard) — both deployed by
`setup-host.sh` and reachable at `portainer.<HOST_IP>.nip.io` and
`<HOST_IP>:8080`. Portainer's admin login is **seeded on first run** (printed at
the end of setup as `admin / <password>`, also in `~/apps/portainer/admin-password`),
so it never hits its first-launch security timeout — change the password under
Portainer › My account.

```

- **One container per app**, all on a shared external `web` network; Traefik
  routes by `Host` header. No app publishes a port (Traefik owns :80).
- The wizard image carries `openssh-client` + `rsync` + `sshpass` so **Deploy
  now** can push to the host (incl. its own host) over SSH.
- `scripts/setup-host.sh` is idempotent — safe to re-run to update.

### Agent API — hand a project to another Claude session

`/api/agent/*` is a token-authenticated HTTP API (no install, just `curl`) that
lets a *different* Claude session read and edit one project directly. Mint a key
from the UI (**Connect Agent** in the home bar, or **Share with agent** on a
project) — you get a paste-in block for the other session — or via
`POST /api/projects/:id/agent-tokens`. A `write` key can edit the plan,
regenerate/assess/apply/deploy, and pull the project's deploy **SSH + API keys**
(`GET /api/agent/connections`); any key can read **every** project for cross-app
architecture context (`GET /api/agent/projects`) but never another project's
secrets. `GET /api/agent` self-describes the whole surface. Full reference:
**[AGENT-API.md](AGENT-API.md)**.

## Notes

- **No secrets stored.** The wizard collects only non-secret integration values;
  generated structures ship key placeholders. Secrets entered in the GUI — the
  **Deploy now** SSH password and the **Claude API key** for reverse-engineering
  — are used transiently per-request and never written to disk on the server.
  (A `localStorage` "remember on this device" option keeps the API key in the
  owner's browser only.)
- **Exception — the agent API surfaces env-configured secrets on purpose.** A
  `write` agent key can read the wizard's own deploy/integration credentials for
  its project (`GET /api/agent/connections`): the `DEPLOY_SSH_*` target and the
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `LINEAR_API_KEY` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GROK_API_KEY` env
  values, plus any per-project overrides an agent stored. This is how a handed-off
  session learns how to reach the Docker host. Read keys never get secret values,
  and no key ever sees another project's secrets. Keep the wizard on a private
  network and revoke keys you're done with.
- The generated ADRs/requirements/milestones are docs-kit's **worked examples** —
  the project's real answers live in `PLAN-INTAKE.json`, and `AI-HANDOFF.md` tells
  a coding agent to rewrite the examples into the project's real artifacts
  (inferring implementation, covering common blind spots, and never polluting an
  existing tracker project).
- **Updating the generator:** `lib/docs-kit.js` is a vendored copy of the Sequence
  repo's root `docs-kit.js`. Refresh it with `cp ../Sequence/docs-kit.js
  lib/docs-kit.js` (adjust the path). The AI-handoff prompt lives in
  `handoffOf()` in `server.js`, so refreshing the kit never clobbers it.

## Reverse-engineer from code ("Use an existing app to start")

New projects start with a choice: **Start from scratch** (the wizard) or **Use
an existing app**. The second path uploads an app's code and drafts a full
intake (product, requirements, decisions, milestones, risks, non-functional) for
the owner to **review and correct** instead of writing from scratch — so an
existing Manus/other app becomes a reviewable plan.

How it's wired (touch-points for future changes):

- **Entry** — `newProject()` in `public/app.js` offers the two paths; "Use an
  existing app" routes to `#/p/:id/import` → `importScreen()`.
- **Upload** — code goes in via the same attachment store, but with relative
  paths preserved (`POST …/attachments?path=`), so folders (`webkitdirectory`)
  and `.zip`s keep their structure. The corpus builder expands `.zip`s with
  `unzip`.
- **Engine** — `lib/reverse-engineer.js`: `buildCorpus()` walks the upload
  (skipping `node_modules`/`.git`/lockfiles/binaries, importance-ranked, char-
  capped), `generateIntake()` calls Claude via **raw fetch** to `/v1/messages`
  with **structured output** (`output_config.format` + `INTAKE_SCHEMA`) so the
  result is schema-valid, and `applyIntake()` (in `server.js`) maps it into the
  wizard's answers. No SDK dependency.
- **The Claude API key** — entered in the import screen (password field), held
  in the browser (optional "remember on this device" → `localStorage`), and sent
  **per-request** to `POST …/generate-draft`. It is used only for that call and
  **never written to disk on the server** (same trust model as the "Deploy now"
  SSH password). A server-side `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var is an optional
  fallback for headless use; `docker-compose.yml` passes it through.
- **No key → handoff** — `generate-draft` returns a reverse-engineering prompt
  the owner runs against their code with a coding agent to produce a
  `PLAN-INTAKE.json`, which they load via **Import a PLAN-INTAKE.json**
  (`POST …/import-intake`). That import button works standalone too.
- **Model & tuning** — defaults to `claude-opus-4-8` at `medium` effort; override
  with `WIZARD_MODEL`. Corpus size cap: `WIZARD_CORPUS_CHARS`. File-type coverage:
  the `TEXT_EXT` set in `lib/reverse-engineer.js`.

Drafted projects carry a `draftFromCode` flag and show a "review and correct"
banner in the wizard.

## Stage 3 — AI build + Linear tracker ("Build full docs + Linear")

After **Generate**, the generated-docs view has a **Build full docs + Linear**
button. It takes the project from a clean scaffold to a rich, project-specific
doc set — and optionally stands up its tracker:

- **AI enrichment** (`lib/enrich.js`) — one structured-output Claude call turns
  the intake into a **Mermaid architecture diagram**, a **Mermaid Gantt**, one
  **Given/When/Then** acceptance criterion per requirement, and full **ADR
  bodies** (context / trade-off / revisit). `render-intake.js` injects these into
  `architecture.html` (diagram), `plan.html` (Gantt), `REQUIREMENTS.md` (G/W/T),
  and `adr/*.md` — Mermaid renders client-side via the CDN script the pages now
  carry. Without enrichment the pages stay as clean deterministic tables.
- **Linear tracker** (`lib/linear.js`, optional) — with a Linear API key + team,
  it creates a **brand-new** Linear project, milestones from the intake, and one
  issue per requirement (priority + "how you'd test it" in the body), linked to a
  milestone. **Safety: it only ever creates a new project — it never writes into
  an existing one**, so it can't pollute a tracker that already holds work.
- **Keys** — the Claude key (reused from the import screen) and the Linear key
  are entered in the GUI, sent per-request, and **never stored on the server**.
- **Endpoints** — `POST /api/linear/teams` (team picker), `POST
  /api/projects/:id/build-full` (`{apiKey, linearKey?, teamId?}`).

The generated bundle is just files, so you can also point a **Claude Code
session** at the docs folder afterward (via the `AI-HANDOFF.md` prompt) to
iterate further — the wizard gives the rich starting point, the session refines.

## Reference uploads (the "Reference" wizard step)

Owners can attach supporting material — PDFs/docs and **existing-codebase
archives** — that the coding agent reads *alongside* the requirements. They are
reference, not scope: the handoff tells the agent to mine them for context but
still build only what the intake describes.

How it's wired (all the touch-points, for future changes):

- **UI** — `public/wizard.js` `renderReference()` (a `kind: 'reference'` step
  after Integrations): a drag-and-drop zone + file list with delete. Styles under
  `/* reference uploads */` in `public/styles.css`. The Generate step shows a
  bundled-files count.
- **Transport** — uploads are a **raw body** POST (`express.raw`), one file per
  request, name in `?name=`. Deliberately *no* multipart dependency — keeps the
  app Express-only.
- **Server** (`server.js`) — routes `GET/POST/DELETE /api/projects/:id/attachments`.
  Names are sanitized to a safe basename (no path traversal), types are
  allow-listed (`DOC_EXT` / `CODE_EXT`), and there's a `MAX_ATTACH_BYTES` (64 MB)
  cap with a JSON 413. `kindOf()` tags each file `doc` vs `code`.
- **Storage** — `storage.attachmentsDir(id)` → `data/attachments/<id>/` (inside
  the persisted volume; cleaned up on project delete).
- **Into the export** — `writeAux()` + `syncReferenceDir()` mirror attachments
  into the generated tree's `reference/` folder (kept in sync on every
  upload/delete, not just at generate), so they ride along in all three exports.
  `refsSection()` lists them in `AI-HANDOFF.md` with the "reference, not scope"
  guidance.
- **To extend** — broaden file types via the `DOC_EXT` / `CODE_EXT` arrays; change
  the size cap via `MAX_ATTACH_BYTES`; both are near the top of the attachments
  section in `server.js`.
